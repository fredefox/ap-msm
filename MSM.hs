 - This module implements all the functions of the Micro Stack Machine (or MSM
 - for short)-library.
 -
 - The implementation follows the specification located at:
 -
 -     [advanced programming course
 -     homepage](http://www.diku.dk/~kflarsen/ap-2014/notes/msm.html)
 -
 - The code structure is loosely based on the handed-out skeletal

 - An `MSM` is a state-monad where the current state (not suprisingly) is an
 - instance of a `State`. A state-monad should return the new state along with
 - the result of some computation. The result, then, in this case is the head
 - of the stack.
 -
 - That is, given the state of the machine, this monad computes
 -
 -   `s0 -> (a, s1)`
 -
 - where
 -
 -   `a`  is the result of the computation
 -   `s0` is the state before the computation
 -   `s1` is the new state resulting from the single computational step

 - Implementation of `interp`
 -
 - This functions type definition confuses me a bit. It's similiar to how
 - io-functions have the type `IO ()`, that is, they dont really return
 - anything they just produce the result that stuff is printed to the screen.
 - This should work similiar I suppose, because the `state` of and `MSM`
 - already defines the program. So it should just take that machine and run
 - it's program.
