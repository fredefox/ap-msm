 - This module implements all the functions of the Micro Stack Machine (or MSM for short)-library.
 -
 - The implementation follows the specification located at:
 -
 -     [advanced programming course homepage](http://www.diku.dk/~kflarsen/ap-2014/notes/msm.html)
 -
 - The code structure is loosely based on the handed-out skeletal implementation:
 -
 -     [msm-skel.hs](http://www.diku.dk/~kflarsen/ap-2014/notes/msm-skel.hs)
 -
 - Written by Frederik HanghÃ¸j Iversen

 - An `MSM` is a state-monad where the current state (not suprisingly)
 - is an instance of a `State`. A state-monad should return the new state
 - along with the result of some computation. The result, then, in this case
 - is the head of the stack.
 -
 - That is, given the state of the machine, this monad computes
 -
 -   `s0 -> (a, s1)`
 -
 - where
 -
 -   `a`  is the result of the computation
 -   `s0` is the state before the computation
 -   `s1` is the new state resulting from the single computational step

 - Decleration of monadic instructions corresponding to `Instr`:

 -
 - * `PUSH Int`
 - * `POP`
 - * `DUP`
 - * `SWAP`
 - * `NEWREG Int`
 - * `LOAD`
 - * `NEG`
 - * `ADD`
 - * `JMP`
 - * `CJMP Int`

 -
 - These functions must all have the type signature:
 -
 -   (MSM m) => a -> m b`
 -
 - For some types `a` and `b`
 -
 - Ponder: `Instr`'s constituent parts have capital names. Functions can only
 - be lower case. How does the connection between these two work?
