# Advanced Programming Assigmnet 2

Written by Frederik HanghÃ¸j Iversen
for the course Advanced Programming
at Copenhagen University 2014

This report is for the second assignment in the course Advanced Programming.

This docuement is written in [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://help.github.com/articles/github-flavored-markdown). It may best be viewed in the markdown-format but is also included as a pdf. The pdf-version was created with [pandoc](http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/).

The project is maintened with git and repository acces can be granted by finding [me on GitHub](https://github.com/fredefox). The hash of the current version that I am hereby submitting is `57d3dc66f3a1fd2c9b1c69eaf5be2bce60931c2c`.

In this report I present the results of my efforts to implement a stack machine written in Haskell. The implementation is acheived through the use of a monadic type `MSM`. [The specification](http://www.diku.dk/~kflarsen/ap-2014/notes/msm.html) for this project is available from the course homepage for Advanced Programming. For the assigment a [skeletal implementation for the implementation](http://www.diku.dk/~kflarsen/ap-2014/notes/msm-skel.hs) was given. The structure in this project loosely follows this.

Source-code is attached along with pdf and markdown-versions of this report.

# Introduction

## A note about non-completion
I commenced writing this report 45 minutes before deadline. I have been working all weekend on the project yet unfortunately I have not been able finish the project entirely.

I have implemented all the functions from the specification with the exception of `runMSM`. I could not get it to type-check.

Obviously this is not a full implementation but I hope that I will get an opportunity to resubmit my solution once I get some much needed feedback on my current attempt.

Since I do not have a full implementation it has also not been possible to do any testing on the current implementation.

My goal with this report will then be to document what I have been able to implement and evaluate what things I believe to have implemented correctly 

## Code structure
All source-code is available in `MSM.hs`.

All functions are annoted with comments where appropriate.

This is the first code I have ever written in Haskell. Perhaps my code illustrates this. My own thinknig is that the main tell probably is that I use a limited set of concepts from the programming language.

Each bullet in the specification corresponds to a comment in the source-code that start with:

```haskell
{-
 - ***
 -
 - ...
 -
 -}
```

## Code-review
Multiple definitions in this library are taken directly from the specification. These include: `Inst`, `Prog`, `Error`, `ErrorType`, `interp` and `runMSM`. Other definitions are given partially. No place in my code have I gone against a definition that was given.

I have not used `Error` or `ErrorType` anywhere in my code.

I will skip all the more or less trivial types and focus on the monads. Now. On to the things that I *did* define. A `State` is defined like this:

```haskell
data State =
    State {
        prog  :: Prog,
        pc    :: Int,
        stack :: Stack,
        regs  :: Regs
    } deriving (Show)

initial :: Prog -> State
initial pr = State pr 0 [] Map.empty
```

Here the definition is given along with the convenience-function `initial` that creates the initial-state for an `MSM` with the program `pr`.


### The monad `MSM`
The Micro Stack Machine (`MSM`) itself is defined like this:

```haskell
newtype MSM a = MSM (State -> (a, State))
```

An `MSM` is `Monad` which in turn is a `Functor`. Here is how `MSM` becomes an instance of these:

```haskell
instance Functor MSM where
    f `fmap` MSM sfc = MSM $ \s -> let (a, b) = sfc s
                                   in (f a, b)

instance Monad MSM where
    return a = MSM $ const (a, initial [])
    (MSM sfc) >>= f = MSM $ \s -> let (a, b)  = sfc s
                                      (MSM g) = f a
                                  in   g b
```

I think maybe I could have reused the `fmap`-operator in my definition of `>>=` but I am not sure.

My inspiration for this implemention comes from the `State`-monad. My thinking is that an `MSM` is basically just a specific kind of `State`-monad where the "state" is unsurpisingly an instance of `State`.

### Monadic machine-instructions

The machine instructions are:

  * `PUSH Int`
  * `POP`
  * `DUP`
  * `SWAP`
  * `NEWREG Int`
  * `LOAD`
  * `NEG`
  * `ADD`
  * `JMP`
  * `CJMP Int`
  * `HALT`


The implementation of the monadic instructions were rather tedious and quite straight-forward. An example of one such instructions is the `push`-function defined like this:


```
push     :: Int -> MSM ()
push a   =  MSM $ \state ->
    ((), state { stack = a : stack state } )
```

The important thing to note about all these instructions are that they should be monadic - i.e. return an instance of `MSM`. I have chosen to let most of them return an `MSM ()` for instructions that were just supposed to alter the state of the machine.

### The interpreter
Implementing the interpreter was where I had the most serious problems and most likely the only place where my code has serious short-comings.

Working with the implementation I was doing detective-work to try and get the return-types to line up properly. It still confuses me a bit how `interp` can be a constant yet serve as a function that interprets something. I know this problem is at the heart of understanding monads - but it feels like I am a lot closer to understanding it.

My function `getInst` serves as a monadic way of accessing the next instruction to execute on the machine.

`interpInst` is basically just a method to translate from instances of `Inst` to functions that can be executed on an `MSM`.

The implementation of `interp` is taken directly from the specification.

`runMSM` does not typecheck and is left in the library for reference. Here is the implementation:

```haskell
runMSM :: Prog -> Either Error Int
runMSM p =
  let (MSM f) = interp
  in fmap snd $ f $ initial p
```

Here is the analysis that I performed on the issue (this is a quote from a question I posted on the course forum):

> `initial p` returns `State`, `f` has type `State -> ((), State)`. But I cant `fmap` `snd` in there on the second element in the tuple (which is what I recon it is trying to do since: `fmap snd ((),(1,2)) == ((),(2))`). But `State` obviously cannot be treated as a tuple.

### Testing
Unfortunately no formal testing has been done.

# Conclusion
My efforts to implement a monadic stack machine in haskell has been presented. The attempt was not a success. My own thought as to what I have done wrong has been presented. Work will continue on implementing this. And hopefully with some proper feedback a final solution will be presented.
